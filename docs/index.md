# Joel's Resource Page

## Welcome

This is a personal collection of technical resources, guides, and scripts I've developed while working on various GIS and technology projects—both professionally and in my own time. The documentation here serves as a knowledge base for solutions I've implemented, configurations I've worked through, and code snippets I've found useful.

## What You'll Find Here

This resource page is organized into several key areas:

### Knowledge Base
A collection of how-to guides and problem-solving documentation covering topics such as:

- **ArcGIS Development**: [Working with ArcGIS Pro](Knowledge_Base/add_h3_pro.md), custom Python environments, and H3 hexagonal indexing
- **Cloud Development**: [Azure Functions setup](Knowledge_Base/azure_function_setup.md) and development workflows on macOS
- **GIS Analysis**: [GeoAnalytics Engine code samples](Knowledge_Base/geoanalytics_snippets.md) and spatial analysis patterns
- **Development Tools**: [Visual Studio Code remote SSH setup](Knowledge_Base/visual_studio_code_remote_ssh.md) and [iOS app development with ArcGIS](Knowledge_Base/ios_app_dev_arcgis_vscode.md)
- **Enterprise GIS**: [Notebook server configurations](Knowledge_Base/notebook_server_60_percent.md) and performance optimizations

### Enterprise Installation Guides
Detailed instructions for deploying and configuring ArcGIS Enterprise systems, including:

- [Custom Docker container images for ArcGIS Notebook Server](ArcGIS_Enterprise_Installation/create_custom_notebook_image.md)
- Deployment on both Ubuntu and Windows platforms
- Enterprise Container System (ECS) deployment information

### Scripts and Automation
Practical shell and Python scripts for system administration tasks:

- Certificate management for Esri systems
- Web Adaptor installation automation
- Log file management and rotation
- Kerberos authentication setup for network mounts

### Jupyter Notebooks
Working examples and analytical workflows demonstrating:

- [Spatial joins using H3 hexagonal indexing with GeoAnalytics](notebooks/0.20-intersect-h3-geoanalytics.ipynb)
- Performance optimization techniques for large-scale geospatial analysis

## Purpose

These resources reflect real-world solutions to problems I've encountered. They're documented here both as a reference for my future self and to potentially help others working on similar challenges in the GIS and technology space.
