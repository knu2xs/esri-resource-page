# SitRep 04 Oct 2024

## 1 - Critical Timebound Completed

- Discuss near term plan for transit index.
- Participate in Pro Retrospective.

## 2 - Other High Importance Completed

- Add ability to quickly calculate headway statistics in GTFS data, a key quality of service metric in the research.
- Ensure when ingesting GTFS data, if `agency_id` is not provided in the `routes.txt` table, it is populated automatically _if only one_ agency is provided in the `agency.txt` table, a frequent pattern allowed by the GTFS specification when the dataset only has data from a single agency.
- Get rough transit index workflow built to include multiple stops for a single Point-of-Interest.
- Add ability to validate transit modality codes enabling checking for both strict GTFS and GTFS with the European codes.
- Create table item in ArcGIS Online for Community Maps to hydrate with contributors providing static links to their GTFS resources to download.
- Build script for downloading all BC Data

## 3 - Shifting Priorities

#### Escalate

- Workflow for updated Transit Index

#### Diminish
 
- Processing next iteration of Living Atlas transit data.
