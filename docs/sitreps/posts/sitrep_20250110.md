## 1 - Critical Timebound Completed

- 

## 2 - Other High Importance Completed

- US Department of Transportation (USDOT) National Transportation Database (NTD) data download preliminary workflow, download workflow for raw data.
- Standardize modality descriptions based on `route_type` codes so Living Atlas Transit Layers' symbology works.
- Create solution for matching modality from lines to stops using the `ntd_id`, but this only assigns modality for just over 60% of data due to multiple modalities for just under 40% of the records.
- Create solution to assign nearest line modaltiy to remaining 40% of stops.

## 3 - Shifting Priorities

#### Escalate

-

#### Diminish
 
- Foursquare delivery on ice.
