## 1 - Critical Timebound Completed

- Participated in two bugouts.

## 2 - Other High Importance Completed

- Create method to maintain list of manually flagged records to exclude from display.
- Integrate method to add exclusion flagging from manually identified list to main dataset processing workflow.
- Create method to apply symbology and scale visibility from maintained online layers to an ad-hoc created group layer.
- Create tool to create a layer at runtime from processed GTFS data in a File Geodatabase.
- Republish lines addressing manually identified straight line features, excluding these features from display.
- Update Living Atlas layers to filter out `esri_excluded` features.
- Process and review submitted data from Alcaldía de Villa, ESP. The data does not include shapes, so only stops can be processed.
- Process submitted data from Cali, COL.
- Mentor Dan Peterson in how to use Transit tools to create bus route geometries using stops and a transportation network to possibly generate lines for the Alcaldía de Villa data.
- Build method to calculate sinuosity statistics for geometries, descriptive statistics of distances between verticies and a ratio of geometry length to the distance between the start and end vertices.

## 3 - Shifting Priorities

#### Escalate

#### Diminish
