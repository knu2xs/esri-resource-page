## 1 - Critical Timebound Completed

- 

## 2 - Other High Importance Completed

- Built and examined summaries of Foursquare quality assurance checks to detect validation patterns in data.
- Troubleshoot and resolve issue with `esri_valid_ba` if Foursquare data due to adding `spam` filtering with Dan.
- Resolve issue with all vintages being delivered into final dataset.
- Rebuild and run all data through Quality Assurance tests.
- Break out ability to easily get spark session for local testing with Geoanalytics engine on both Mac and Windows with Pro.

## 3 - Shifting Priorities

#### Escalate

-

#### Diminish
 
-

**Notes:** Debugged issue with sharp decrease in valid counts with Dan by looking at the factors being considered for
`esri_valid_ba` column, determining the issue was with `nulls` being populated in the spam flag column. This is resolved
by using `when.otherwise` logic to explicitly populate the boolean values.
