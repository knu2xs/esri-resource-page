## 1 - Critical Timebound Completed

- Split updated Foursquare open source processing workflow to perform spatial overlay separately from rest of processing to reduce need for large cluster during entire workflow (reduces compute costs).
- Create step to create cached main dataset in Foursquare processing workflow, making it easier to create the three output datasets for quality assurance, software (Geoenrichment) and Basemaps.
- Update Foursquare open source processing to output all quality assurance flags into parquet dataset capable of being imported into a File Geodatabase for review.
- Execute full workflow for creating Foursquare sample (California and Great Britian) dataset with quality assurance flags as part of data processing workflow to ensure ready for April open-source data release.

## 2 - Other High Importance Completed

- Assist Andrew to create [logic for outputting formatted hours strings](https://gist.github.com/knu2xs/456364122840a71dfb704313970292a5) in Safegraph processing.
- Update Parquet import processing script to handle path to schema.csv file one level in directory, common when outputting from Spark, to simplify file geodatabase imports from Parquet datasets.
- Address issue when creating zipped archives as part of building feature classes from Foursquare Parquet datasets due to getting hung on `.lock` files.

## 3 - Shifting Priorities

#### Escalate

- Create public transit dataset ready for release.

#### Diminish

-
