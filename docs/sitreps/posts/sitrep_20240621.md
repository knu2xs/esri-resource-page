- Develop function and accompanying Geoprocessing tool to bulid main dataset by crawling staged datasets and only using the most current agency and modality combinations to assemble the main dataset.
- Add creation of median centroids by agency to main dataset creation.
- Add creation of extent rectangles by agency to main dataset creation.
- Develop function and accompanying Geoprocessing tool to use polygons to automatically update bookmarks in WebMap to extents of all contributing agencies.
