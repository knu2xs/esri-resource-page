## 1 - Critical Timebound Completed

- Add updated Spokane and UK transit datasets to publication candidate.
- Investigate issues with Netherlands transit data.
- Build transit publication candidate, publish to ArcGIS Online and update 

## 2 - Other High Importance Completed

- Address Foursquare locations *inside* Esri campus discovered through quality assurance checks. Add the Foursquare ID's to the remove list, and build datasets with these removed.
- Troubleshoot and address issue with not being able to download all GRFS transit submissions from ArcGIS Online.
- Develop script to download new GTFS transit submissions from ArcGIS, stage any new submissions and, if new submissions, build a release candidate.
- Develop script to build release candidate without having to open ArcGIS Pro.
- Create scheduled task to check for newly submitted GTFS transit datasets, stage them, and, if new, build release candidate at 03:00 every weekday morning.

## 3 - Shifting Priorities

#### Escalate

- Shift to addressing outstanding issues (notably scheduled pulls) in GTFS transit data processing postponed due to focus on Foursquare processing.
- Start digging back into transit accessibilty index, even though not enough time to make notable progress.

#### Diminish
 
- Foursquare processing, just a little whack-a-mole addressing small issues detected, removing some locations, detected after loosening filtering criteria.
