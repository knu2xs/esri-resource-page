## 2 - Other High Importance Completed

- Public tranist NTM data missing Carto ID for the following NTM identifiers `['50066', '50118', '50276', '50433', '60015', '60152', '60159', '60185', '60256', '70044;70048', '88293']`
    - The following appear to be missing required files, so going to rerun process to split out data from main: `['60015', '60152', '60159', '60185']`.
    - Resolve bug in processing when attempting to add NTM UID in processing pipeline, ensure using `esri_agency_name` instead of `agency_name`; using `esri_` prefixes in processing to explicitly deleniate Esri fields added to default GTFS schema.
