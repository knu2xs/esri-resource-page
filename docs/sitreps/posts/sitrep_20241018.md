# SitRep 18 Oct 2024

## 1 - Critical Timebound Completed

- Meet with US Department of Transportation to get Public Transportation data

## 2 - Other High Importance Completed

- Addressing issues raised in published Public Transit data
- Deconstruct how properties are looked up from stops > stop_times > trips > routes, espeically how properites are retrieved for parent stops from children and subsequently assigned to any remaining unretreived records from parents.
- Rebuild property lookup for stops to routes and agency tables based on updated methodology created during investigation of property lookup ensuring correct agencies are looked up for every stop.
- Investigate lines not in final output for United Kingdom data, determining these lines do not have any trips and consequently no routes associated with them. Also, as part of this investigation, determined there are duplicate route lines from multiple trips for the same route in the output.
- Rebuild lookup from shapes > trips > routes, only keeping a single geometry for each valid route by dropping duplicate trips.
- Start creating dataset for transit index evaluation.

## 3 - Shifting Priorities

#### Escalate

- Deep dive into issues raised by investigation of new national datasets, and rectify these issues.

#### Diminish

- Transit index evaluation dataset.
