## 2 - Other High Importance Completed

- Build complete Public Transit dataset to include Friday's San Antonio submission through Community Maps and USDOT National Transit Map (NTM) data
- Review and quality check for duplicates in merged Transit data between Community Maps contributions and USDOT NTM data.
- Create simple sinuosity index, but determine it does not adequately capture issues with Jersey data.
- Build workflow and pipeline for creating Foursquare Geoenrichment dataset from the Foursquare Open Source data.
- Build and evaluate results for Foursquare Open Source, and determine the offshore buffer needs to be tighter. Their data is just that bad.
