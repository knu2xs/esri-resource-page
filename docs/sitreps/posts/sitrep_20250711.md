## 1 - Critical Timebound Completed

- Publish public transit with Canadian data.

## 2 - Other High Importance Completed

- Create script to iteratively build each agency GTFS dataset contained within the Canadian data, and compile into single Canadian dataset for inclusion.
- Build and quality check Canadian data.
- Reorganize Canadian data collected through proxy accounts, moving these into quarantine, thus prioirtizing the data from full Canadian dataset.
- Build geometry fix for feature in Calgary to fix long straight line on single bus route.
- Build release candidate, and catch build error due to duplicate datasets in Canada. Make update. Test to ensure correct datasets being collected, and proceed to build second release candidate.

## 3 - Shifting Priorities

#### Escalate

- Add full Canadian dataset to public transit data to support User Conference opportuntites.

#### Diminish

- Build Canadian business summary data generation script. Determined to simply use the actual business listing locations, so mission aborted.
