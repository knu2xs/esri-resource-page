## 1 - Critical Timebound Completed

-

## 2 - Other High Importance Completed

- Through quality assurance review, discover nine staged datasets in public transit with missing file geodatabases...datasets which did not process. Debug issue and process these seven datasets.
- Create standard script to add unique identifier onto data from both National Transit Mapping (NTM) data downloaded from ArcGIS Online with far superior linework, and the data provided by US DOT as raw General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS). This enables associating at the record level and adding calculated value-add fields to the data.
- Process all NTM GTFS partitioned data to update and add value-add attributes.
