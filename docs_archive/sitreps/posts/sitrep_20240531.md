## 1 - Critical Timebound Completed

- Prep resources and present at New Zeland Transit meeting
- Prep and publish Aukland, NZ and Otago, NZ data to ArcGIS Online
- Stage UK data
- Present transit initiative to Pacific Northwest office in bi-annual meeting and encourage solicitation of contributions from regional clients
- Configure ECS instance for transit analysis

## 2 - Other High Importance Completed

- Quickly migrate transit development efforts to temparary ECS intance due to driver update causing significant issues with development tower.
- Initiate rebuild with local systems administrator (Robert) on development tower.
- Create method to infer metadata contributor and submission date from title, and modalities from routes.txt.
- Update GTFS processing to use full submission timestamp instead of just the day to deconflict multiple submissions in the same day (Utah loves to do this).
- Update group layer creation stragegy in GTFS processing to use group layer file (`*.lyrx`) included in Python package, and save a copy with the staged data.

## 3 - Shifting Priorities

#### Escalate

- Mitigate local development tower isssues to minimally affect transit processing development work
