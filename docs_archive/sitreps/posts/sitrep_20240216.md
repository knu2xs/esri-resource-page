## 1 - Critical Timebound Completed
- Foursquare and Geocoding
    - Kickoff and orientation meeting to get Foursquare into Geocoding so results are in alignment between Business Analyst, Places and Geocoding
- Technical Discussion with Andrew
    - Assessing technical aptitude for Data Engineering (he's good)
- Transit in Velocity Meeting
    - Update with Cory (SE Transit) utilizing AVL through Velocity with GTFS stop_times to provide near-real-time situational awareness and enable forensic analysis for planning
    - Updated Cory on current progress of Transit Accessibility Index; he's especially interested in the different headway metrics by time of day as a safety and quality of service metric.
- Coordinated with Dan Lee and Dan Peterson on solution for Foursquare localization

## 2 - Other High Importance Completed
- Foursquare
    - 24 Hours Filtering - Coordinated with Yann and Stacy to ensure desired filtering being applied
- Transit Accessiblity - GTFS Data Loading and Processing
    - Created workflow *and* ArcGIS Pro Tool to validate *all* data for an area-of-interest (download and validate *all* GTFS data for NYC in less than five minutes)
        - addresses missing `calendar` instances
        - fills intermediate stop times to provide accurate analysis
    - Created workflow to assemble all GTFS resources needed for Transit Accessibility Index calculation
        - includes derivative columns needed for existing transit index logic
        - includes new qualtiy of service metric, mean headway, for all times, daytime, evening and overnight to include in updated factor calibration with Elif
- Data Ingestion Validation
    - Mentoring Yann creating Jupyter Notebook to evaluate incoming data metrics
