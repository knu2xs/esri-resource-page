## 1 - Critical Timebound Completed

-

## 2 - Other High Importance Completed

- Process most recent LA public transit submission. Requires custom script since data is submitted in a single archive with bus and rail in separate GTFS datasets.
- Figure out issue with large number of Spanish public transit datasets not processing, year defined as `9999`, so replacing with current year if encountered in processing pipeline.
- Figure out issue with large number of Spanish public transit datsets not processing, datetime strings prepended with spaces, so using `strip` to clean up parsing to datetime objects.

## 3 - Shifting Priorities

#### Escalate

-

#### Diminish

-
