## 1 - Critical Timebound Completed

-

## 2 - Other High Importance Completed

- Build complete Public Transit dataset to include Friday's San Antonio submission through Community Maps and USDOT National Transit Map (NTM) data
- Review and quality check for duplicates in merged Transit data between Community Maps contributions and USDOT NTM data.
- Create simple sinuosity index, but determine it does not adequately capture issues with Jersey data.
- Build workflow and pipeline for creating Foursquare Geoenrichment dataset from the Foursquare Open Source data.
- Build and evaluate results for Foursquare Open Source, and determine the offshore buffer needs to be tighter. Their data is just that bad.
- Create country polygon dataset with 500 meter nonoverlapping buffered area to capture points-of-interest along shorelines and exclude those 
clearly in the ocean.
- Convert country and coastal polygon feature class to Parquet with geometry encoded as well known binary for compatability with Big Data Toolkit.
- Use updated country and coastal data to reprocess Foursquare Open Source data in AWS EMR, save quality assurance subset and full dataset, download 
both, and convert subset to feature class for QA review.
